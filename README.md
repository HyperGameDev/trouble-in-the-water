## Here lies remnants of the original plan, for reference if we ever pick it up again

Night Time Fishing
Good fish VS Monster

River
Leave house to fish
Activate fishing spot (has particles over it)
	Minimum: One spot
	Otherwise, random other spots
Bar appears and randomly vascillates
Mininum: Hold a key to increase bar
If doable: Typing game to increase the bar
If bar is in the middle for 5sec consecutively
	OR
	You survive the full time:
		Fish is caught, +1 point
If bar hits the left edge at any point,
	line breaks, have to try again

Random chance that fish is a monster;
	if so, have to run and hide in the house
	until mosnter goes away

Stretch: If typing version, every typo increases monster odds
	Otherwise not getting it in 5sec increases monster odds

Minimum game, one fishing spot 
chance for monster
